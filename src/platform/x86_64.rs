/// An owned reply to a :c:func:`z_get`.
///
/// Like all `z_owned_X_t`, an instance will be destroyed by any function which takes a mutable pointer to said instance, as this implies the instance's inners were moved.
/// To make this fact more obvious when reading your code, consider using `z_move(val)` instead of `&val` as the argument.
/// After a move, `val` will still exist, but will no longer be valid. The destructors are double-drop-safe, but other functions will still trust that your `val` is valid.
///
/// To check if `val` is still valid, you may use `z_X_check(&val)` (or `z_check(val)` if your compiler supports `_Generic`), which will return `true` if `val` is valid.
